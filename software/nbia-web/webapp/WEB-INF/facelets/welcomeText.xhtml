<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/chestradiography/repository.html" target="_blank">Chest Image Repository</a> 
(CIR) is sponsored by the 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/" target="_blank">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a>,
which is part of the 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control</a>. 
The CIR is intended to serve as a databank of images which depict a variety of occupational
respiratory diseases, particularly the pneumoconioses. The repository was developed by NIOSH to collect
digitally-acquired routine chest radiographs, computerized tomography (CT) images, and associated relevant medical
information, if available.
</p>
<p>
The repository images will be used by several organizations in various applications, to improve worker safety and health:
<ul>
<li>
new reference standards for the 
<a href="http://http://www.ilo.org/" target="_blank">International Labour Organization</a> 
(ILO) pneumoconiosis classification
</li>
<li>
new digital images for the teaching syllabus, periodic examinations, and quality assurance exercises offered by the
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/chestradiography/breader.html" target="_blank">NIOSH B Reader Program</a>
</li>
<li>
research into improving the identification and classification of work-related lung disease
</li>
</ul>
Both domestic and international contributors are invited to submit candidate images to this repository that were obtained
through worker medical screening and surveillance, clinical practice, or research activities.
